Restaurant Menu Ordering Program from the Console


This program simulates a user ordering food from a variety of choices from a restaurant in the console.
The program was written with the idea that not everyone can go to the restaurant when they need food.
It includes simple AI methods for example to try and prompt the user to buy bigger fries when they have a
smaller beverage(a tactic used by franchises to make more money).
